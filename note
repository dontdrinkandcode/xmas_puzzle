So, you're the kind of person that wants to save Christmas? 

Good luck with that! 

Christmas is my least favourite time of the year and there's no way I'm going to make it easy for you. 

You'll never find the password to my grinchcoin account, and don't even think about a brute-force attach as the number of possible passwords is 9654231111854761531684. 

Look, even if you did manage to get the grinchcoins back and use them to buy back all of the presents there's nearly no way you'd be able to get them back to Santa in time to save Christmas. 

He probably hasn't even noticed the presents are gone as he tours the country letting people sit on his lap and tell him what they want for Christmas. Little do they know that Children across the land are in for a big surprise! I hate all of the nonsense about who has been naughty or nice, what's the difference anyway?

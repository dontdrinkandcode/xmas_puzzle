Can you help save Christmas?

The Grich has stolen everyones presents, sold them, and invested the proceeds in his favourite crypto-asset grinchcoin (which he uses to purchase non-FUNgible tokens). The only way to save Christmas is to find the Grinch's password, sell the grinchcoin, and rebuy the presents - and so you had better be quick (grinchcoin is prone to crashes and so if you take too long you might never be able to recover the presents).

The only leads we have are a data file recovered from a rusty USB drive, and a couple of commits of a note he wrote to gloat about ruining Christmas. Please help us find the password - you're our last hope!
